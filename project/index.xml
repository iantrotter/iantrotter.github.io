      <title>Developing the Norwegian Energy System in the European Energy Transition (NORENS)</title>

      <description>The primary objective of NORENS is to develop a broader and better knowlegde base for the problem of planning an efficient, profitable and robust electricity production and transmission infrastructure for Norway in light of the ongoing transition of the European energy system.
This project is a collaboration between researchers at the Faculty of Environmental Sciences and Natural Resource Management (MINA) and the School of Economics and Business at the Norwegian University of Life Sciences, the Center for International Climate Research at the University of Oslo, the Technical University of Denmark (DTU), the Federal University of Viçosa, the University of Oldenburg and The Norwegian Water Resources and Energy Directorate (NVE).</description>

      <title>Reverse the Curse: Can Quantum Computing Lift Bellman’s Curse of Dimensionality?</title>

      <description>The purpose of this research is to develop improved methods for the numerical resolution of stochastic dynamic optimisation problems. Although Bellman’s infamous “curse of dimensionality” impedes the numerical resolution of all but the simplest such problems, approximation methods have had considerable success. At the same time, recent research shows that the quantum computing paradigm could revolutionise the resolution of optimisation problems.
However, no research appears yet to have considered the application of quantum computing to stochastic dynamic optimisation problems.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Numerical Stochastic Dynamic Optimisation for Applied Economics</title>
      <link>http://www.iantrotter.com/project/accelerating-sdp/</link>

      <description>Stochastic dynamic optimisation problems are found in several branches of economics: consumer theory, producer theory, resource economics, macroeconomics, game theory, operations research, and so forth. And most of the time, the numerical resolution of these problems is considered computationally intractable due to the so-called &amp;ldquo;curse of dimensionality&amp;rdquo;.
The main goal of this project is to develop new computational methods for the numerical resolution of stochastic dynamic optimisation problems. Improved techniques for resolving this problem class could have a great impact on society, as it would improve decision support systems for a large number of institutions, and for instance improve the management of natural resources, adaptation to and mitigation of climate change, financial management and business decisions.</description>
