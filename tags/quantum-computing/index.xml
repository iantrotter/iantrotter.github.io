      <description>Introduction The purpose of this research is to develop improved methods for the numerical resolution of stochastic dynamic optimisation problems. Although Bellman’s infamous “curse of dimensionality” impedes the numerical resolution of many such problems, approximation methods have had considerable success. At the same time, the quantum computing paradigm could revolutionise the resolution of optimisation problems.
Can we leverage the combined power of approximation methods and quantum computing in order to improve performance and enable the resolution of larger instances of such problems than is currently possible?</description>
