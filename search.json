Although some may not find this kind of thing worthy to discuss, maybe a small note here could help some other researcher avoid wasting their precious time and coming to the same dead end. So here\u0026rsquo;s a little story of my failed idea.\n\nIn the beginning, I thought it was a great idea: I would simply take the leveling algorithm discussed in Warren B. Powell\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;Approximate Dynamic Programming\u0026rdquo; \u0026ndash; in which it is presented in a unidimensional context \u0026ndash; and then generalise it, so that I could use it on a multidimensional problem.\nMore specifically, I wanted to use it on a space with 48 dimensions, which is not even a very large number of dimensions (but certainly nothing to sneer at either). That is, I wanted a way to gradually improve my value function, learning while simulating the system. I\u0026rsquo;ve used this algorithm in the unidimensional case before, and it is simple and performs well.\nIn one dimension, at every sample obtained from the value function, I would simply split the segment of the value function into two parts. After spending a long time thinking about how to do it in two dimensions, I finally realised that it would require splitting the value function into four intervals at the arrival of every new sample. After spending even more time thinking about the three-dimensional case, I realised that I would then need to split the value function into eight intervals at the arrival of every new sample.\nAt that time, it dawned on me: the arrival of each new sample would require me to split one interval of the value function into $2^n$ intervals, in which $n$ is the number of dimensions. For a low number of dimensions this is doable \u0026ndash; for 48 dimensions, not possible: $2^{48} \\approx 2.8 \\times 10^{14}$. No matter how great your computer, or how efficient your program, this is simply unviable!\nThis setback throws a spanner in the works for the algorithm that I\u0026rsquo;m developing. Now I will have to find a different way to represent and learn my value function.\nThrough this, I gained a very healthy dose of appreciation for \u0026ldquo;cutting planes\u0026rdquo;, which has now become one of my new favourite tools.

Powell, which reads relatively easy and presents a fascinating view of the subject, together with the historical roots within many fields of research. The author has a great overview of the field, and combines fields of research that were previously considered disting or even competing. But more than a technical reference, the book is inspiring and makes you feel that there are vast unexplored possibilities, and shows the reader how to go about exploring those possibilities. \u0026ldquo;Dynamic Programming and Optimal Control\u0026rdquo; by Dimitri P. Bertsekas, which is one of the giants of the field. The book contains everything you will need to know, and to a great level of detail. There are two volumes, and they\u0026rsquo;re in their 4th edition. You\u0026rsquo;ve probably seen this book being referred to before, because it is simply awesome. It is much heavier than Powell\u0026rsquo;s book, more detailed and more \u0026ldquo;academic\u0026rdquo;, in a sense. In a good sense, that is. Highly recommended, and great to have around as a reference.  Apart from these two textbooks, I would like to recommend two research articles that I find particularly inspiring that solve stochastic dynamic optimisation problems:\n \u0026ldquo;Multi-stage stochastic optimization applied to energy planning\u0026rdquo; by Pereira and Pinto (1991). This article is ingenious, and forever changed the way the hydrothermal scheduling is thought about all over the world. They had the great idea of approximating the future value function in the hydrothermal scheduling problem with a piecewise linear function, and then use the dual variables from the linear optimisation problem to construct the cutting planes and approximate the value function. It is a brilliant idea, but the article is humble and unassuming, yet introduces one groundbreaking result after another. This is an article that changed the world forever, but it might be hard to appreciate this fact without knowing what the state-of-the-art for the hydrothermal scheduling problem was like at the time. \u0026ldquo;SMART: A Stochastic Multiscale Model for the Analysis of Energy Resources, Technology, and Policy\u0026rdquo; by Powell et al. is another article that solves the hydrothermal dispatch problem. The authors managed to exploit theoretical properties of the value function in order to solve (approximately) a huge resource management problem with a detailed model at an hourly resolution, for a planning horizon of several decades. That is, they solved a problem with hundreds of thousands of time periods, which is very impressive.  I realise that my two favourite articles both solve the hydrothermal dispatch problem. But that is, after all, one of my favourite problems, and one of the best showcases of stochastic dynamic optimisation: it is an important and tangible problem with a deep theory behind it.\n","date":1529519949,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1529519949,"objectID":"bf91071b5e6d54ed6fe6b503b25eba63","permalink":"http://www.iantrotter.com/post/sdp-literature/","publishdate":"2018-06-20T15:39:09-03:00","relpermalink":"/post/sdp-literature/","section":"post","summary":"As part of my project on stochastic dynamic optimisation, I am knee-deep in good literature on the subject.

They are exceptionally useful: in general, we are pretty good at solving problems involving polynomials and pretty rubbish at solving problems involving pretty much anything else. Here, we show you two elegant Taylor expansions that keep showing up here and there in different areas of research.\n\nIn many dynamic systems, equations or functions you often find a dampening term that looks something like this: $$ e^{-\\rho t}, \\rho \u0026gt; 0 $$ This is a standard way of including dampening in any dynamical system: the greater the time that passes ($t$), the smaller the term $e^{-\\rho t}$, and when multiplying it with some other factor, it makes the factor fade off into zero.\nWhen $x$ is close to zero, we can use a simple trick to get an intuitive feel for the value of $e^{x}$. First, note that $e^0 = 1$. Secondly, recall that the derivative of $e^{x}$ with respect to $x$ is simply $e^{x}$. We will se these two observations to build a Taylor expansion of $e^{x}$ around $x_0=0$.\nThe general form of the first-degree Taylor expansion of a general function $f:\\mathbb{R}\\to\\mathbb{R}$ around a point $x_0$ is the following: $$ f(x_0 + \\Delta x) \\approx f(x_0) + f\u0026rsquo;(x_0) \\Delta x. $$ Using the function $f(x) = e^{x}$ and constructing a Taylor expansion for $e^x$ around $x_0=0$, we find the following: $$ e^{x_0+x} \\approx e^{x_0} + e^{x_0}x. $$ From which \u0026ndash; since $x_0=0$ \u0026ndash; we can simply see that: $$ e^x \\approx 1 + x. $$\nThis is an incredibly elegant and powerful approximation: when $x$ is small, we can approximate $e^x$ by simply $1+x$. So if you see something like $e^{-0.03t}$ and start wondering what that actually means, just remember that you can approximate $e^{-0.03}$ simply by $1-0.03=0.97$. That is, it is a very slow decay, with about 97% of the original amount remaining after each period.\nFor those who want greater accuracy, you can easily use a higher degree Taylor expansion. However, this has been left as an exercise for the curious reader.\nI promised two amazing Taylor expansions, so here\u0026rsquo;s the other one: $$ \\ln(1+x) \\approx x$$ Huh - what?\nSuppose that you want to know the approximate value of $\\ln(\\cdot)$ at a point that is close to $1$. WE know that $\\ln(1)=0$ and that the derivative of $\\ln(x)$ is simply $1/x$, so the Taylor expansion can be written like this: $$ \\ln(1+x) \\approx \\ln(1) + \\frac{1}{1}x $$ Or in other words: $$ \\ln(1+x) \\approx x$$\nThis is also one of those functions that keep popping up when you\u0026rsquo;re playing around with applied mathematics, so it\u0026rsquo;s nice to have such a simple approximation in order to get an intuitive feel of what you\u0026rsquo;re working with. Those who read my post on the rule of 72 will know what I\u0026rsquo;m talking about.\nWith these two approximations fresh in mind, go forth and approximate!\nSometimes we can solve a problem almost correctly in a small fraction of the time it takes to solve the problem exactly.

These are common characteristics of real-world problems \u0026ndash; and all such problems present a great opportunity to study the art and science of stochastic dynamic optimisation!\n\nThere are a wealth of problems that fall within stochastic dynamic optimisation problems, innumerably many in fact.\nHere is a small set of examples of real-world problems which can be modelled as stochastic dynamic optimisation problems:\n Inventory problems such as warehousing Natural resource management such as land use problems, timber management, and water resource management Economic growth Logistical problems such as route determination and shortest path problems Scheduling problems such as airline scheduling Option valuation problems Irreversable investment decisions (closely related to option valuation theory!) Monetary policy Portfolio management  The problem is, though, that we are only capable of treating the very simplest of these problems exactly. The so-called \u0026ldquo;curse of dimensionality\u0026rdquo; kicks in very quickly, and we are overwhelmed by the number of possible future scenarios. Most practical applications, therefore, have to rely on solving the problem approximately and with very clever algorithms.\nThat means that approximation methods for this type of problem are essential. And any trick that the structure of each specific problem permits, must be used to the maximum extent. Those that find and are able to exploit latent structures within the problem, and make the appropriate approximations, are handsomely rewarded: some exemplary studies have managed to treat problems with thousands of decision and state variables, and hundreds of thousands of time periods. Such examples are rare, but very impressive.\nThe field that is consolidating under the name Approximate Dynamic Programming attempts to do exactly this: combining insight into the problem structure with advanced numerical methods in order to solve problems that were previously intractable. And some amazing new problems are being solved. Well, solved approximately, that is. Usually the solutions are nearly optimal, but available at a much, much lower computational cost.\nThis is a field in which mathematical creativity meets pragmatism in order to create new solutions, using advanced mathematics, numerical methods and technology to solve problems that have a large impact on the real world: an exciting area of research where results can have a profound impact.\n","date":1519865963,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1519865963,"objectID":"2599d4ebf3d171fee8437e5c04b11153","permalink":"http://www.iantrotter.com/post/everything-is-sdp/","publishdate":"2018-02-28T21:59:23-03:00","relpermalink":"/post/everything-is-sdp/","section":"post","summary":"Stochastic dynamic optimisation problems are everywhere \u0026ndash; quite simply because most of the choices we make have consequences in the future, and incorporate some uncertainty: this means that the decision process needs to take into account not only whatever happens at the moment that the decision is made, but also how it may impact future decisions.

Suppose, for instance, that the population growth rate is 2% per year. To calculate approximately how long time it will take for the population to double, we simply divide 72 by the growth rate in percent: $$ \\text{Years to double} = \\frac{72}{2} = 36$$ A growth rate of 3% gives a doubling time of 24 years, 4% gives 18 years, 6% gives 12 years, and so on. In the case of exponential decay, the rule will give the half-time.\nThis is an absolutely incredible approximation rule. It gives you superpowers: you are now able to simply glance quickly at a growth or decay rate and immediately get a feel for the doubling or halving time, which is often a more intuitive measure than the rate itself.\nSo how does it work?\nFirst we set up an equation showing exactly what we mean by doubling time, and how it relates to the rate of (compounded) growth. If $p$ is the growth rate and $a_0$ is the initial quantity, we know that after one period, the quantity $a_1$ will be given by: $$ a_1 = a_0(1+p). $$ To calculate the quantity after two periods, we apply the growth rate to $a_1$: $$ a_2 = a_1(1+p) = a_0 (1+p)(1+p) = a_0(1+p)^2. $$ You\u0026rsquo;ve probably got the point already: after applying the growth rate for $n$ periods, the quantity will be: $$ a_n = a_0(1+p)^n. $$ If we are looking for the doubling time, we want to know how many periods it takes before the quantity has grown to twice its initial value, $2a_0$. In fact, we want to know the number of periods $n$ such that: $$ 2a_0 = a_0(1+p)^n. $$ Solving this equation for the number $n$ is not so hard: first we can divide both sides by $a_0$ to make it disappear entirely from the equation (it turns out that the doubling time does not depend on the initial quantity!), and then we take the natural logarithm of both sides of the equation and simply solve for $n$: $$ 2 = (1+p)^n $$ $$ \\ln(2) = n\\ln(1+p) $$ $$ n = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{\\ln(1+p)} $$ This equation explicitly gives the exact number of periods $n$ that the initial quantity will take to double, given the growth rate $p$. But as a rule-of-thumb, it would be very handy, because it involves calculating two logarithms and doing a division, which is too taxing for my poor little head.\nSo from here, we make two wonderful approximations. Firstly, we note that when the growth rate $p$ is small, we can approximate $\\ln(1+p)$ simply by $p$: $$ \\ln(1+p) \\approx p. $$ You can try this on your calculator, and see that it is a fairly accurate approximation for small values of $p$, up to about $0.1$ (that is, a 10% growth rate).\nBut wait a minute \u0026ndash; how did we do that? And how can we be sure that it is so? Testing things on the calculator may convince some people, but certainly not a critical mind. And furthermore, I don\u0026rsquo;t find it to be a very satisfactory explanation. So let\u0026rsquo;s make the argument a little more convincing.\nA few prerequisites: we all know that the derivative of $\\ln(x)$ is simply $1/x$. And we also know that $\\ln(1)=0$. A \u0026ldquo;first-order Taylor expansion\u0026rdquo; is a way of approximating the value of a function at a point using the value of the function and its derivative at a nearby point: $$ f(x_0 + \\Delta x) \\approx f(x_0) + f\u0026rsquo;(x_0) \\Delta x. $$ Now, let\u0026rsquo;s try creating a first-order Taylor expansion of the function $\\ln(x)$ around the point $x_0=1$: $$ \\ln(1+\\Delta x) \\approx \\ln(1) + \\frac{1}{1}\\Delta x. $$ Then remember that $\\ln(1)=0$, and use $\\Delta x = p$: $$ \\ln(1+p) \\approx p. $$ So this approximation is simply the first-order Taylor expansion of the natural logarithm $\\ln(\\cdot)$ around the point $x_0 = 1$! (If you are concerned about the accuracy of the approximation, rest assured that it will be of the order $O(p^2)$.).\nBack to the doubling time. Insert the first wonderful approximation $\\ln(1+p) \\approx p$ into the denominator: $$ n \\approx \\frac{\\ln(2)}{p}. $$ Calculating $\\ln(2)$ can be a little tricky too, so let\u0026rsquo;s try to do something about the numerator. Calculating $\\ln(2)$ to the first ten decimal points gives the following: $$ \\ln(2) = 0.6931471806 = 69.31471806\\% $$ Since the numerator is constant, let\u0026rsquo;s just put in a number that\u0026rsquo;s close to the number $\\ln(2)$, but which is a little prettier and easier to work with. Since $p$ will normally assume values such as 1%, 2%, \u0026hellip;, it would be conventient to use a number that is easily divided by whole number percentages. Turns out that, amongst the numbers close to 69%, 72% is the number with the largest amount of prime factors \u0026ndash; which means that it can be evenly divided by many different integers:\n   Number Factors Number of Factors     65 5,13 2   66 2,3,6,11,22,33 6   67  0   68 2,4,17,34 4   69 3,23 2   70 2,5,7,10,14,35 6   71  0   72 2,3,4,6,8,9,12,18,24,36 10   73  0    So we choose 72% to approximate 69.31471806% in this case, because it is a number which is particularly easy to divide by many integers that we are likely to encounter (5, 7 and 10 being notable exceptions, but for that you can rather use 70 instead).\nTherefore, we can approximate $n$ \u0026ndash; the number of periods required for doubling the initial quantity \u0026ndash; by: $$ n \\approx \\frac{72}{p}. $$ And there you have it: the rule of 72. A simple approximation rule for thinking about growth (or decay) rates, supported by an interesting mathematical sleight-of-hand.\nSometimes we can solve a problem almost correctly in a small fraction of the time it takes to solve the problem exactly.

This is a problem class that pops up absolutely everywhere, and has been a great obsession of mine ever since I first encountered it when working with valuation of natural gas storage. It was love at first sight, and currently permeates pretty much all my work. It is an incredible privilege to be able to follow my passion for (numerical) stochastic dynamic optimisation.\nThe surprise in this research project is the inclusion of quantum computing. The last few years we have seen amazing developments \u0026ndash; theoretical and practical \u0026ndash; in quantum computing. I won\u0026rsquo;t hesitate to admit that I am very new to quantum computing, my understanding of it leaves much to be desired, and the whole subject is massively intimidating. I\u0026rsquo;m sure I\u0026rsquo;m not the only one who feels that way.\nHowever, it is an interesting frontier of research, and it is so promising that we can\u0026rsquo;t help but wonder what possibilities lay ahead. Is it possible that this new computing paradigm can help me solve larger and more complex stochastic dynamic optimisation problems than we are currently capable of handling? Or is it, perhaps, a dead end? Or perhaps somebody already did, but I don\u0026rsquo;t know about it yet? Or maybe it is even obvious for those who are more familiar with quantum computing whether it is worth pursuing or not?\nSo here we go, venturing into the unknown, without knowing what lies ahead. Humble about our shortcomings, our lack of knowledge and understanding, yet at the same time excited to satisfy our curiosity.\nFor the next year, we will work tirelessly on stochastic dynamic optimisation problems. The first step is to study state-of-the-art approximation algorithms for these problems, and attempt to make some contributions of our own. In a second stage of the project \u0026ndash; conditional on additional funding \u0026ndash; the deeper understanding gained from working with approximation algorithms will be leveraged, in which we aim to combine our understanding of powerful approximation methods for stochastic dynamic optimisation with quantum computing paradigms.\nThese days, it feels like we are at the dawn of the quantum computing era.

As anyone who has done a PhD probably knows: it takes dedication, a lot of elbow grease and many sleepless nights to complete a PhD.\nSecondly, I appreciate the opportunity to draw some additional attention to my own research, and to the excellent research of my friends and colleagues, as well as to my graduate program, my department and my institution.\nEven so, however, I am wary of awards in science, which might be an attitude I picked from reading Dr. Richard Feynman\u0026rsquo;s autobiography when I was in high school. Mainly there are two reasons why I\u0026rsquo;m not such a great fan of awards in science:\nFirstly, science is \u0026ndash; directly or indirectly \u0026ndash; a collaborative effort. Even if the scientist receiving the award may not have been working on a team, we are all standing on shoulders of giants and our work has been enabled by those who came before us. To bestow an award only on the scientist who happened to dot the i\u0026rsquo;s and cross the t\u0026rsquo;s, one is perhaps not paying sufficient attention to the entire foundation on which the work rests.\nSecondly, there is no way to objectively compare works against each other and rank them, especially so shortly after publication, and I find it slightly pretentious to pretend to have that ability. The impact or importance of a discovery is often only obvious after many years, sometimes decades or centuries. In this sense, awards are more reminiscent of a popularity contest than a science contest, rewarding only those contributions whose impacts are immediately obvious and recognised (usually because they are uncontroversial and not too far from the dominating view of the time). Science already advances one funeral at the time, according to Planck, and handing out awards to those whose discoveries conform to expectations will help perpetuate scientific orthodoxy.\nOn the other hand, though, awards in science seem relatively harmless. Sometimes it is worthwhile to pay a particular homage to the anchor of the relay race of science. And so what if not all awarded discoveries age that well? That appears to happen to all types of awards (e.g. Titanic). It\u0026rsquo;s still a great opportunity to make some fanfare, drum up some positive press, celebrate our collective achievements and, perhaps, increase the overall interest in science.\n","date":1508119200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1508119200,"objectID":"67a6748bd82ccaff63db53286650d355","permalink":"http://www.iantrotter.com/post/phd-thesis-award/","publishdate":"2017-10-16T00:00:00-02:00","relpermalink":"/post/phd-thesis-award/","section":"post","summary":"On wednesday last week, the winners of the awards (one per field) for best PhD theses in Brazil in 2016 were announced.
