Here, we show you two elegant Taylor expansions that keep showing up here and there in different areas of research.\n\nIn many dynamic systems, equations or functions you often find a dampening term that looks something like this: $$ e^{-\\rho t}, \\rho \u0026gt; 0 $$ This is a standard way of including dampening in any dynamical system: the greater the time that passes ($t$), the smaller the term $e^{-\\rho t}$, and when multiplying it with some other factor, it makes the factor fade off into zero.\nWhen $x$ is close to zero, we can use a simple trick to get an intuitive feel for the value of $e^{x}$. First, note that $e^0 = 1$. Secondly, recall that the derivative of $e^{x}$ with respect to $x$ is simply $e^{x}$. We will se these two observations to build a Taylor expansion of $e^{x}$ around $x_0=0$.\nThe general form of the first-degree Taylor expansion of a general function $f:\\mathbb{R}\\to\\mathbb{R}$ around a point $x_0$ is the following: $$ f(x_0 + \\Delta x) \\approx f(x_0) + f\u0026rsquo;(x_0) \\Delta x. $$ Using the function $f(x) = e^{x}$ and constructing a Taylor expansion for $e^x$ around $x_0=0$, we find the following: $$ e^{x_0+x} \\approx e^{x_0} + e^{x_0}x. $$ From which \u0026ndash; since $x_0=0$ \u0026ndash; we can simply see that: $$ e^x \\approx 1 + x. $$\nThis is an incredibly elegant and powerful approximation: when $x$ is small, we can approximate $e^x$ by simply $1+x$. So if you see something like $e^{-0.03t}$ and start wondering what that actually means, just remember that you can approximate $e^{-0.03}$ simply by $1-0.03=0.97$. That is, it is a very slow decay, with about 97% of the original amount remaining after each period.\nFor those who want greater accuracy, you can easily use a higher degree Taylor expansion. However, this has been left as an exercise for the curious reader.\nI promised two amazing Taylor expansions, so here\u0026rsquo;s the other one: $$ \\ln(1+x) \\approx x$$ Huh - what?\nSuppose that you want to know the approximate value of $\\ln(\\cdot)$ at a point that is close to $1$. WE know that $\\ln(1)=0$ and that the derivative of $\\ln(x)$ is simply $1/x$, so the Taylor expansion can be written like this: $$ \\ln(1+x) \\approx \\ln(1) + \\frac{1}{1}x $$ Or in other words: $$ \\ln(1+x) \\approx x$$\nThis is also one of those functions that keep popping up when you\u0026rsquo;re playing around with applied mathematics, so it\u0026rsquo;s nice to have such a simple approximation in order to get an intuitive feel of what you\u0026rsquo;re working with.

Suppose, for instance, that the population growth rate is 2% per year. To calculate approximately how long time it will take for the population to double, we simply divide 72 by the growth rate in percent: $$ \\text{Years to double} = \\frac{72}{2} = 36$$ A growth rate of 3% gives a doubling time of 24 years, 4% gives 18 years, 6% gives 12 years, and so on. In the case of exponential decay, the rule will give the half-time.\nThis is an absolutely incredible approximation rule. It gives you superpowers: you are now able to simply glance quickly at a growth or decay rate and immediately get a feel for the doubling or halving time, which is often a more intuitive measure than the rate itself.\nSo how does it work?\nFirst we set up an equation showing exactly what we mean by doubling time, and how it relates to the rate of (compounded) growth. If $p$ is the growth rate and $a_0$ is the initial quantity, we know that after one period, the quantity $a_1$ will be given by: $$ a_1 = a_0(1+p). $$ To calculate the quantity after two periods, we apply the growth rate to $a_1$: $$ a_2 = a_1(1+p) = a_0 (1+p)(1+p) = a_0(1+p)^2. $$ You\u0026rsquo;ve probably got the point already: after applying the growth rate for $n$ periods, the quantity will be: $$ a_n = a_0(1+p)^n. $$ If we are looking for the doubling time, we want to know how many periods it takes before the quantity has grown to twice its initial value, $2a_0$. In fact, we want to know the number of periods $n$ such that: $$ 2a_0 = a_0(1+p)^n. $$ Solving this equation for the number $n$ is not so hard: first we can divide both sides by $a_0$ to make it disappear entirely from the equation (it turns out that the doubling time does not depend on the initial quantity!), and then we take the natural logarithm of both sides of the equation and simply solve for $n$: $$ 2 = (1+p)^n $$ $$ \\ln(2) = n\\ln(1+p) $$ $$ n = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{\\ln(1+p)} $$ This equation explicitly gives the exact number of periods $n$ that the initial quantity will take to double, given the growth rate $p$. But as a rule-of-thumb, it would be very handy, because it involves calculating two logarithms and doing a division, which is too taxing for my poor little head.\nSo from here, we make two wonderful approximations. Firstly, we note that when the growth rate $p$ is small, we can approximate $\\ln(1+p)$ simply by $p$: $$ \\ln(1+p) \\approx p. $$ You can try this on your calculator, and see that it is a fairly accurate approximation for small values of $p$, up to about $0.1$ (that is, a 10% growth rate).\nBut wait a minute \u0026ndash; how did we do that? And how can we be sure that it is so? Testing things on the calculator may convince some people, but certainly not a critical mind. And furthermore, I don\u0026rsquo;t find it to be a very satisfactory explanation. So let\u0026rsquo;s make the argument a little more convincing.\nA few prerequisites: we all know that the derivative of $\\ln(x)$ is simply $1/x$. And we also know that $\\ln(1)=0$. A \u0026ldquo;first-order Taylor expansion\u0026rdquo; is a way of approximating the value of a function at a point using the value of the function and its derivative at a nearby point: $$ f(x_0 + \\Delta x) \\approx f(x_0) + f\u0026rsquo;(x_0) \\Delta x. $$ Now, let\u0026rsquo;s try creating a first-order Taylor expansion of the function $\\ln(x)$ around the point $x_0=1$: $$ \\ln(1+\\Delta x) \\approx \\ln(1) + \\frac{1}{1}\\Delta x. $$ Then remember that $\\ln(1)=0$, and use $\\Delta x = p$: $$ \\ln(1+p) \\approx p. $$ So this approximation is simply the first-order Taylor expansion of the natural logarithm $\\ln(\\cdot)$ around the point $x_0 = 1$! (If you are concerned about the accuracy of the approximation, rest assured that it will be of the order $O(p^2)$.).\nBack to the doubling time. Insert the first wonderful approximation $\\ln(1+p) \\approx p$ into the denominator: $$ n \\approx \\frac{\\ln(2)}{p}. $$ Calculating $\\ln(2)$ can be a little tricky too, so let\u0026rsquo;s try to do something about the numerator. Calculating $\\ln(2)$ to the first ten decimal points gives the following: $$ \\ln(2) = 0.6931471806 = 69.31471806\\% $$ Since the numerator is constant, let\u0026rsquo;s just put in a number that\u0026rsquo;s close to the number $\\ln(2)$, but which is a little prettier and easier to work with. Since $p$ will normally assume values such as 1%, 2%, \u0026hellip;, it would be conventient to use a number that is easily divided by whole number percentages. Turns out that, amongst the numbers close to 69%, 72% is the number with the largest amount of prime factors \u0026ndash; which means that it can be evenly divided by many different integers:\n   Number Factors Number of Factors     65 5,13 2   66 2,3,6,11,22,33 6   67  0   68 2,4,17,34 4   69 3,23 2   70 2,5,7,10,14,35 6   71  0   72 2,3,4,6,8,9,12,18,24,36 10   73  0    So we choose 72% to approximate 69.31471806% in this case, because it is a number which is particularly easy to divide by many integers that we are likely to encounter (5, 7 and 10 being notable exceptions, but for that you can rather use 70 instead).\nTherefore, we can approximate $n$ \u0026ndash; the number of periods required for doubling the initial quantity \u0026ndash; by: $$ n \\approx \\frac{72}{p}. $$ And there you have it: the rule of 72. A simple approximation rule for thinking about growth (or decay) rates, supported by an interesting mathematical sleight-of-hand.\nSometimes we can solve a problem almost correctly in a small fraction of the time it takes to solve the problem exactly.

As anyone who has done a PhD probably knows: it takes dedication, a lot of elbow grease and many sleepless nights to complete a PhD.\nSecondly, I appreciate the opportunity to draw some additional attention to my own research, and to the excellent research of my friends and colleagues, as well as to my graduate program, my department and my institution.\nEven so, however, I am wary of awards in science, which might be an attitude I picked from reading Dr. Richard Feynman\u0026rsquo;s autobiography when I was in high school. Mainly there are two reasons why I\u0026rsquo;m not such a great fan of awards in science:\nFirstly, science is \u0026ndash; directly or indirectly \u0026ndash; a collaborative effort. Even if the scientist receiving the award may not have been working on a team, we are all standing on shoulders of giants and our work has been enabled by those who came before us. To bestow an award only on the scientist who happened to dot the i\u0026rsquo;s and cross the t\u0026rsquo;s, one is perhaps not paying sufficient attention to the entire foundation on which the work rests.\nSecondly, there is no way to objectively compare works against each other and rank them, especially so shortly after publication, and I find it slightly pretentious to pretend to have that ability. The impact or importance of a discovery is often only obvious after many years, sometimes decades or centuries. In this sense, awards are more reminiscent of a popularity contest than a science contest, rewarding only those contributions whose impacts are immediately obvious and recognised (usually because they are uncontroversial and not too far from the dominating view of the time). Science already advances one funeral at the time, according to Planck, and handing out awards to those whose discoveries conform to expectations will help perpetuate scientific orthodoxy.\nOn the other hand, though, awards in science seem relatively harmless. Sometimes it is worthwhile to pay a particular homage to the anchor of the relay race of science. And so what if not all awarded discoveries age that well? That appears to happen to all types of awards (e.g. Titanic). It\u0026rsquo;s still a great opportunity to make some fanfare, drum up some positive press, celebrate our collective achievements and, perhaps, increase the overall interest in science.\n","date":1508119200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1508119200,"objectID":"67a6748bd82ccaff63db53286650d355","permalink":"http://www.iantrotter.com/post/phd-thesis-award/","publishdate":"2017-10-16T00:00:00-02:00","relpermalink":"/post/phd-thesis-award/","section":"post","summary":"On wednesday last week, the winners of the awards (one per field) for best PhD theses in Brazil in 2016 were announced.

The full option strategy is based on a least-squares Monte Carlo algorithm. Model simulations show potential for higher revenue in three UK LNG terminals. Numerical experiments show how storage and regasification capacities affect revenue.","tags":null,"title":"Optimal LNG (liquefied natural gas) regasification scheduling for import terminals with storage","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ian Michael Trotter","Torjus Folsland Bolkesjø","José Gustavo Féres","Lavinia Hollanda"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1462060800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1462060800,"objectID":"c3806ba38cef490219b944e0731cbb36","permalink":"http://www.iantrotter.com/publication/electricity-demand/","publishdate":"2016-05-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/electricity-demand/","section":"publication","summary":"A large number of realistic weather paths were generated based on output from a single GCM. The simulated weather paths were used to include weather uncertainty in electricity demand forecasting, in order to present a probabilistic electricity demand forecast for Brazil 2016–2100. Annual Brazilian electricity demand will peak around 2060 at about 1071–1200 TWh, and there is significant weather uncertainty, with approx. 400 TWh separating the 10th and 90th percentiles.","tags":null,"title":"Climate Change and Electricity Demand in Brazil: A Stochastic Approach","type":"publication"}]
